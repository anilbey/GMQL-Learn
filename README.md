# GMQL-Learn
Genomic Space based Machine Learning for GMQL

This project leverages the power of GenoMetric Query Language (GMQL). by adding a wide range of the machine learning
and statistical analysis packages. The Python is selected as language implementation. The reason Python is selected is due to
the strength of its core libraries, its high productivity for prototyping and building reusable systems and its strength as a general-
purpose programming language. This project focuses on bringing machine learning to Bioinformaticians to perform their
analysis on the GMQL data. The project consists of three parts:
1. a genomic space data model,
2. various existing state-of-art machine learning algorithm implementations,
3. functionalities to evaluate and interpret the results of the algorithms.
A good collection of use-cases should also be provided as the proof of concept.
